		<intro>		
    	    <p>A scatter plot using a JavaScript based charting library. The view can be accessed either via
            the "interactive view" action on the executed node or in KNIME Server web portal page. 
	       	</p>
            <p>The configuration of the node lets you choose the size of a sample to display and to enable certain 
            controls, which are then available in the view. This includes the ability to choose different columns
            for x and y or the possibility to set a title. Enabling or disabling these controls via the configuration
            dialog might not seem useful at first glance but has benefits when used in a web portal/wizard execution 
            where the end user has no access to the workflow itself.
            </p>
            <p>
            The node is currently under development and should  be used in production workflows.
